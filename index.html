              <p>
                We are an authorized dealer/partner for AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and Verizon. The
                carriers compensate us for onboarding, support, and account management, so you pay
                the same carrier rates with no added fees while gaining our platform and expertise
                at no cost.

            <details>
              <summary>How does pricing work?</summary>
              <p>Pricing depends on how you choose to work with us.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  If you appoint Celytics as your authorized wireless dealer, our SaaS platform is
                  provided at no cost. In this model, the wireless carriers compensate us for order
                  processing, onboarding, and ongoing account management—so you pay standard carrier
                  rates while gaining full access to our platform and expertise.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If you prefer to keep your existing carrier representative, but still want access
                  to the Celytics platform, we offer our SaaS independently for a minimal monthly
                  fee. That pricing is based on the number of active lines on your account.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Do you support multiple carriers?</summary>
              <p>
                Yes. We work across carriers with consolidated visibility and support, and our
                carrier-compensated model means there is no added cost to you.
              </p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Can we keep our numbers?</summary>
              <p>In most cases, yes. We help maintain continuity while managing changes behind the scenes.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>What size organizations do you work with?</summary>
              <p>We support a range of organizations, from growing teams to large enterprises.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Do you provide reporting?</summary>
              <p>Yes. Reporting is a core part of our service and is tailored to the insights you need.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>How quickly can we get started?</summary>
              <p>
                Most accounts are up and running in minutes to under two hours. Even with thousands
                of lines, it is typically under an hour. In rare cases, onboarding is completed
                within 24 hours after we import your bill and generate the dashboard.
